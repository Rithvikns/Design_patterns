# Observer Pattern in Python

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the **subject**, maintains a list of its dependents, called **observers**, and notifies them of any state changes. This pattern is commonly used in event-driven programming, MVC architectures, and publish-subscribe models.

## Key Components:
1. **Subject (Observable)**: Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any changes.
2. **Observer**: Defines an interface with an update method that receives notifications.
3. **ConcreteObserver**: Implements the observer interface and reacts to updates from the subject.

## How It Works:
- Observers register (attach) themselves to a subject.
- When the subject's state changes, it notifies all attached observers.
- Observers receive the update and respond accordingly.

## Advantages:
✔ Decouples the subject and observers, improving modularity.
✔ Supports dynamic relationships between objects.
✔ Enhances code maintainability and reusability.

## Use Cases:
- Event-driven systems
- GUI frameworks (e.g., button click listeners)
- Real-time notifications
- Logging mechanisms

## Example:
Imagine a news publisher system where multiple subscribers (observers) receive notifications when a new article is published. The **news publisher** acts as the subject, and the **subscribers** act as observers that get notified when new content is available.
